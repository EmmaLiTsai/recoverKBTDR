Description: Takes raw csv files of KBTDR records (trace and timing dots) and 
    applies a series of corrections to transform the original data into a 
    digital format that is comparable with data from modern TDRs. Functions 
    involve scan centering, zero-offset correction, arc removal, transforming 
    the x-axis into a regular time series, depth transformation, and spline 
    smoothing. The final output of these methods is a continuous csv file that 
    can be easily investigated using dive analysis software.
