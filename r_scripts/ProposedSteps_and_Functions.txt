Outline of Steps and Major Functions: 

(1) File tidying and centering of the scan 
	Here, I imagine that I will have a file tidying function to deal with default column 
	names from ImageJ image processing. 

	I also imagine another function that will center the scan using the y values of the 
	timing dots. This includes creating a brief fuzzy merge with the trace and timing 
	dots csv files. After this fuzzy merge, I plan to create y value correction 
	values to shift the above trace up or down such that all time dots are along the 
	same horizontal line. After this step, the trace file should be in good shape to 
	continue with recovery. This is an extra processing step, and might not be included  
	in the final code package. 

(2) Transform coordinates by radius arm equation 
	Here, I imagine a function that will apply the arc equation to the data. This should 
 	be a simple and straightforward function to remove the arc from these data. 

(3) Transform x-axis to time with time dots
	This step could be part of a larger function with step 2, but here I imagine a 
	function that will cut the trace into different sections based on the time dot x
	values. From this, I expect to assign an interval value based on the time period, 
	and then use this interval value and the times associated with this period to 
	transform to time. 
 
(4) Transform y-axis from PSI to depth 
	Here, I expect a simple function to use the psi scale at the end to transform the 
	trace from PSI to depth. This should be a straightforward and simple equation. 

(5) Smoothing 
 	This process should take the depth values from step 4 to simplify the trace using 
	a form of smoothing method. Currently this is spline smoothing, but is subject to 
 	change.
